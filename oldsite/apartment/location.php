    <p>Situated in a quiet residential area of Lagos, just outside of the old city walls, the apartment provides a
        perfect base for those wishing to explore Lagos and its beaches on foot, or further afield with a car. It
        is located on the third floor (no lift), and benefits from having two large balconies; one facing east and the other west.
        The east facing balcony enjoys a superb sea view, overlooking Lagos bay and the Monchique mountains to the north.

    <p>Directly outside the apartment building is a small bus stop, from which you can take the local buses to all three
    of Lagos' beaches. Within a 5-10 minute walk, you can be down at the river front by the marina, crossing over to
    Meia Praia or exploring the marina. There are numerous supermarkets/shops within a 5-10 minute walk, and plenty of
    local restaurants and eateries nearby. Whilst private parking is not available, there is plentiful off road parking
    and we have never struggled to find a space.</p>
