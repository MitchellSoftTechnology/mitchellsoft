    <p>In an ideal world, we wouldn't charge our family and friends to stay in our apartment, as we just want it to be
    enjoyed by everyone! However, in reality, we have ongoing costs (standing charges for electricity, gas and water,
    council tax, etc.) as well as costs that we incur when people stay in the apartment (cleaning before and after,
    laundry, charges for electricity, gas and water consumption, wear and tear). This means that we do, unfortunately,
    have to charge you for using the apartment, in order to cover these costs. The pricing structure is as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Low season (November-April) - <strong>£150 p/week</strong></li>
        <li>Mid season (May-June/September-October) - <strong>£200 p/week</strong></li>
        <li>High season (July-August) - <strong>£300 p/week</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you would like to stay for longer than a week (e.g. 2 weeks, 3 weeks, etc) then we will give you a
    <strong>10% discount</strong>, by way of passing on the savings that we will make on cleaning and laundry
    services.</p>

    <p>We don't ask for a deposit, as we know that plans can change and that is to be expected from time to time, but
    we do ask that you pay for your stay 4 weeks prior to your arrival. Unfortunately, we won't be able to charge for
    periods of less than a week, because the cleaning and laundry costs associated with a stay are exactly the same. You
    are more than welcome to stay for less than a week, but sadly the cost to do so will be the same.</p>

    <p>The calendar below shows when the apartment is in use. If you would like to stay in the apartment, and can see
    that it is free, then please let us know as soon as possible.</p>
