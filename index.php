<p>MitchellSoft Technology Ltd is a software house, based in London, providing both IT consultancy and software
development services. Founded in 2011 as MitchellSoft Ltd, we began providing software development services to various
companies, as well as working on our own in-house projects. Our key consultants began their professional development
careers at IBM, working on numerous enterprise applications such as WebSphere MQ and CICS transaction server. Experience
with all stages of the software development and product release lifecycle has given us the ability to provide clients
with a high level of expertise and advice relating to best practices.</p>

<p>We specialise in agile and test-driven software development, both at client sites and in-house, believing that
short development cycles, prototyping and continuous customer feedback are all essential to successful product
development and delivery. We believe in providing quality software solutions that are self documenting, fully tested and
driven by customer requirements right from the word go, so that ongoing maintenance and enhancements are both easily
achievable and quickly implemented. Code quality and simple design is at the heart of our development ethos.</p>
