                            MitchellSoft Technology Ltd is a software house, based in London, providing both IT
                            consultancy and software development services, and specialising in marine applications. Founded in 2011 as MitchellSoft Ltd, we began
                            providing software development services to various companies, as well as working on our own
                            in-house projects.
                            Our key consultants began their professional development careers at IBM,
                            working on numerous enterprise applications such as WebSphere MQ and CICS transaction
                            server. Experience with all stages of the software development and product release lifecycle
                            has given us the ability to provide clients with a high level of expertise and advice
                            relating to best practices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We specialise in agile and test-driven software development, both at client sites and
                            in-house, believing that short development cycles, prototyping and continuous customer
                            feedback are all essential to successful product development and delivery. We believe in
                            providing quality software solutions that are self documenting, fully tested and driven by
                            customer requirements right from the word go, so that ongoing maintenance and enhancements
                            are both easily achievable and quickly implemented. Code quality and simple design is at the
                            heart of our development ethos.

                        <p class="consultant-text">A senior software engineer, with over 16 years commercial experience, Kate kickstarted her career with a Computer Science
                            Degree at the University of Bristol. From there, she was accepted on IBM's "Extreme Blue" internship scheme and took a
                            graduate placement at their top UK development lab. She began developing in lower level languages, developing IBM's top 
                            z/OS transaction server, CICS, as part of the Web Services team. Kate worked with languages such as Assembler and C, as 
                            well as Java and C++, before discovering Python and falling in love with its features, community and incredible 
                            versatility.
                            <br></br>
                            Kate has now specialised in Python for over 11 years, and has worked large companies such as the media giant Sky, as 
                            well as medium sized companies and startups, in a range of sectors. She excels at back end development, such as 
                            integrations, large scale computations, algorithms and API development, but also has experience of full stack 
                            development using frameworks such as Django and can deliver front end changes when required. Her passion for clean, 
                            quality code is evident in all that she does, and her experience in test driven development is an asset to any project.

                                Code runs through Alex's veins.  Cut him and green monospaced text will flow out, tests first!  
                                Alex has been crafting code professionally for over 16 years.  It all started for him way before that, 
                                however, and his passion for writing software even saw him taking his desktop computer on a scooter to his 
                                Saturday retail job where his accommodating boss would let him work on Visual Basic projects between serving customers!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Alex has worked as a back end Java developer with some of the most successful companies across multiple industries, 
                                but has also gained great experience working as a Systems Test Engineer, a GUI Developer and as a Level 3 Service Engineer.  
                                All this, underpinned by his Computer Science degree and thirst for a deep technical understanding of the technologies that 
                                he works with have given him a solid platform from which to smash the contracts that he works on.  Since co-founding MitchellSoft 
                                Technology Ltd, Alex has also enjoyed having the freedom to incorporate his long term hobby, mobile app development, into his 
                                professional life and has relished working on several Android and cross-platform apps.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Having clawed his way out of the dark ages of development (waterfall, no automated testing, or tests written by separate teams 
                                weeks after feature development), Alex fully embraces Test-Driven Development, Business-Driven Development, Agile/Scrum and Pair 
                                Programming.  He has firsthand experience of how much quicker this way of developing software is and how much more robust the 
                                end solution will invariably be.  Above all else, when it comes to coding, clarity is king.
