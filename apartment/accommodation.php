    <p>The apartment contains one bedroom with two single beds, a spacious living/dining room with doors to both balconies, a well-equipped kitchen and a decent bathroom. There is a double sofa bed in the living room, meaning that the apartment could accommodate up to 4 people, if required.</p>

    <p>There is seating outside on the east-facing balcony; a perfect place to enjoy breakfast whilst watching the
    ever-changing view across the town and the bay.</p>

    <p>The gas for the building is centrally managed (i.e. several big bottles for the building which get changed on a service contract), so you don't have the inconvenience of having to change gas bottles, as is the case with many properties in Portugal.</p>

    <p>One thing worth noting is that the apartment <strong>does not have a lift</strong>, so may not be suitable for
    those with mobility issues. However, this does mean that the yearly condominium charge is very low, costing only &euro;180 per year.</p>
