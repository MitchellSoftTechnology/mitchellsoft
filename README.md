## Styling


### Font:
* The company Logo used was a_atmosphericregular, I felt the the rigid lines made for a futuristic yet elegant technology font that work well with the company name.
* Over all the main font used was standard Roboto. The standard font felt at home and was very legible.

### Color scheme:

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/color.jpg" alt="color card" aria-label="font used" />
</div>

The colors used where:
- Gray: #1C2331
- Green: #009688
  
I felt both colours complimented the blues and purples in the hero image while giving a contemporary look to the overall site.
